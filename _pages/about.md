I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the **School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Nanjing University**, advised by **Prof. Wenbin Li**. Before joining Nanjing University, I received my **M.S. degree** from **Tianjin University**.

My research interests broadly lie in **multimodal foundation models**, including **high-resolution vision-language models**, **remote sensing foundation models**, and **uncertainty estimation for model responses**.
