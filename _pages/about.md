I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Nanjing University, advised by [Prof. Wenbin Li](https://liwenbin.cn/) and co-supervised by [Prof. Yuekun Yang](https://is.nju.edu.cn/yyk/main.htm).

My research focuses on **multimodal foundation models**, with particular interests in **high-resolution vision–language modeling**, **remote sensing foundation models**, and **uncertainty quantification and calibration**.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at [yunkaidang1@gmail.com](mailto:yunkaidang1@gmail.com).
